## 🗃️ Dataset Used

This project uses a combined dataset of multiple real and fake face image sources to create a large, diverse, and balanced dataset for training and testing the deep learning model. The following publicly available datasets from Kaggle were used:
| Dataset                                | Source                                                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                |

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Deepfake-Face-Detection-WebApp.git
cd Deepfake-Face-Detection-WebApp

2️⃣ Backend Setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
Activate virtual environment:

for windows - venv\Scripts\activate
for linux/macOS - source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies - pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run FastAPI Server
uvicorn main:app --reload

4️⃣ Frontend Setup

Open the frontend:
cd ../frontend

Open index.html directly in browser
OR
Use VS Code Live Server


🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads a face image
2. Image is sent to FastAPI backend
3. Image preprocessing is applied
4. Trained model predicts Real or Fake
5. Result with confidence score is shown on UI
